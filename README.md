# BenzenDataEngineer
### First of all install all the requirements file 
### Secondly save the Bezen.py and .csv file in the save folder
### Thirdly run the code using terminal i.e
     python bezen.py
## Part 1 - Count the number of empty cells in the price field of csv file
 So an will get printed in the terminal 
## Part 2 - Counting the number of without price and with price in each category,level_1 and product_type:

### On the basis of Category

##### Image showing the number of product without prices in each Category :

### On the basis of Level_1

### On the basis of Product_type

##### Image showing the number of product without prices in each Product_type : 
!['on the basis of Product_type without prices'](https://github.com/ankitgarg2001/BenzenDataEngineer/blob/master/on%20the%20basis%20of%20product%20type%20without%20prices.jpg)

##### Image showing the number of product with prices in each Product_type :
!['on the basis of Product_type with prices'](https://github.com/ankitgarg2001/BenzenDataEngineer/blob/master/on%20the%20basis%20of%20product%20type%20with%20prices.jpg)

## Part4 - Mean Price for Each Category :

### Table showing Mean Price for each Category :
